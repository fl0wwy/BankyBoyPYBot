# BankyBoyPyBot
a little accountant i made using Telegram's API. This is my first ever python project, nothing to brag about :) Telegram: @BankyBoyPyBot

This bot uses the "Account" class in the account_generator.py file to store the data.
bot2.py runs all the operations using the "pyTelegramBotAPI" library.
